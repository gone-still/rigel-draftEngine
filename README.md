# rigel-draftEngine
2D Game Engine I designed using Love2D (https://love2d.org/), written in Lua (https://www.lua.org/). 

Wrote all code and created the art myself. The art was designed mainly in Blender3D (https://www.blender.org/) and Paint Shop Pro.

Developed 2011-2014. Here's a "trailer" I made for promotion and self-motivation, all actions are in-game:
